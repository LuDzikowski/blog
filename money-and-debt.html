								<p>Money plays such a central role in daily life that I have never asked myself where it comes from or what it is. Last year, in a Political Economy of Finance module at King’s College, we explored the question, ‘where does new money come from?’  When my lecturer directed this question to the class, we all had a pretty good guess. Of course, money is ‘printed’ by the central bank. Wrong. Well, sort of. Theories of money creation have been contested throughout recent history, but today there is consensus that both public (central banks) and private (commercial banks) actors contribute to the creation of new money.</p>
								<p>This works as follows. Central banks, for example the Federal Reserve, may ‘create’ money through monetary policy tools available to them such as large-scale asset purchases. When the Fed buys Treasury securities (US government debt) on the open market from market participants (primarily commercial banks) it credits the sellers' accounts with new and corresponding reserve balances, effectively adding 0s to banks’ reserve accounts.[1] </p>
								<p>Most of the new money in the modern economy, however, is created by commercial banks. When I go to the bank for mortgage finance, the bank does not lend me other peoples’ deposits, i.e. deposits create a loan, but rather, the bank will credit my account with the size of the mortgage, i.e. the loan creates the deposit. This is the moment in which new money is created.[2] In the literature, this is referred to as the credit-creation theory of money. It is important to note that the central bank plays a key role in regulating the money supply, or more specifically the monetary base (currency + reserves) through policy rates, bank reserve requirements, and open market operations, but does not directly control the broader money supply. </p>
								<p>If money is being created all the time by both public and private institutions, this begs the question, what is money? There are, again, many diverging views on the answer to this question, and surprisingly, no definitive answer. After some digging, Debt: The First 5000 years, provided me with some reader-friendly clarity on one popular concept of what money is. David Graeber’s book follows money’s introduction in early society and its function throughout different periods of societal evolution. Debt denounces the fictitious ‘barter economy’ in which a farmer would trade two bushels of corn for a new pair of boots and presents a case for some form of money – existing as a unit of account of debt – to have existed as an intermediary to such transactions as long as early traces of society has.[3] ‘Banknotes are just a bunch of circulating IOUs’, Graeber pointedly states.[4] Indicative of this, on any GBP banknote, you will find written, ‘I promise to pay the bearer on demand the sum of [five pounds].’ </p>
								<p>Thus, money is a measurement of debt, or money is a form of debit. The £23.53 in my HSBC bank account (yes…) is redeemable against £23.53 worth of goods and services (or £23.5187 in one week from today). </p>
								<p>Money is a nominal measurement of debt and in the modern economy is ‘created’ to a large extent through the allocation of credit by commercial banks with commercial interests. This possesses significant implications for Western financial infrastructure. Inherently, money as a modern social institution, is arguably unequal. Commercial banks, at their core, are in the business of selling debt through loans. By lending money, they profit from the interest charged, which is the lifeblood of their original business model. Access to these loans – this money – is not equally available. </p>
								<p>Creditworthiness is the criterion used to determine who has access to loans and at what cost. Inherently, this process favours those who already possess wealth. This births a system where the wealthy have access to more and cheaper credit, which they can use to generate greater wealth, while those with less wealth have lesser and more expensive access to credit. A topical example of this was in the recent US senate hearings where the CEOs of Mastercard and Visa admitted that they provide ‘volume discounts’ to companies such as Walmart. Examples abound: Ghana pays a higher interest rate when borrowing in international capital markets than Switzerland, financially distressed companies pay greater interest on debt issuances than Apple, and my Amex credit limit is capped at £6,000 while Taylor Swift’s is likely significantly more. This reflects differences in risk premia. </p>
								<p>In this context, the distribution of money is not neutral. The function of money as a unit of account of debt, coupled with the way that debt is allocated, disproportionately benefits those who are wealthy. This may contribute to a trend toward unsustainable wealth inequality, where the middle class shrinks while the wealthy and poor grow.  </p>
								<p>Another interesting point that I have not yet touched upon is the two components that constitute a loan extended by a commercial bank, (1) the principal and (2) interest. When new money is created in the form of a loan, the money to pay the interest is not. Consider this in a silo. In the silo, no money exists until a loan of £100 is extended to you. The bank requests that you pay this back in ten days, and every day over the next ten days you have to pay the bank £0.50 interest. Where does the money come from to pay the interest if you already bought something with the £10? Let us expand the silo to include one more person, Person X. Person X may decide to apply for a loan from the bank as well and use some of that money to buy a service you are offering. But then how will Person X pay the interest on their outstanding loan? Thus, based on the earlier conclusions made in this note, the amount of money in circulation necessarily grows perpetually which is broadly in line with the understanding that economic growth and new lending are necessary to sustain the modern Western economic model. </p>
								<p>If you find flaws in my thinking, hold a different view, or want to make me aware of some relevant literature which I may have missed, please do! Please reach out via email which you can find on the ‘About’ page. Below, I will also attach a paper that I wrote for one of my modules at King’s which is the longer, more technical, and better-referenced piece from which I drew my ideas for this summary version. </p>
